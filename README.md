## Setup


1. Open Terminal / Power Shell and change directory into where you would like to store project

Run:
```
git clone https://github.com/nicodeas/git-tute.git
```

2. Create a new branch for your group by running (please create branch with the same name as your group):
```
git branch <name of branch>
```

3. To view all branches available (not on github), Run:
```
git branch
```

Now that we have created our branch, it is time we checkout(switch to) that branch so we can edit code!

4. to change to the branch created, Run:
```
git checkout <name of your branch>
```

## Excercise

Now that your group is on the same branch, you are free to add whatever you like to the code base!
